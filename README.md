Here I have uploaded just a subset of projects I have worked on over the years, both from courses and personal projects. They cover a range of topics, from fashion to real estate, and a variety of technical skills, from machine learning to data analysis. While I have dozens of other projects, I have chosen these because they best summarize my progress over the past few years, and embody important moments of discovery and growth. I would be happy to discuss them with you if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at libbyamir33@gmail.com
